# Predicting survival rates

During four weeks between June and July 2020, I took part in an online Bootcamp delivered by Dphi. This notebook corresponds to the final assignment (a small Datathon) from this Bootcamp.

The main objective was to build the best model to predict the chances of survival of a patient after 1 year of treatment.

At first, an exploratory data analysis was performed. Then several baseline models were built, and the best ranked by the F1 score were selected and improved since this was the evaluation criteria for this task.
